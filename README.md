![Design preview for the Easybank landing page coding challenge](./images/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [Easybank Landing Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL w/design comparison: [https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/easybank-landing-page-grid-css-animations-js-scss-PC1gxE5Df](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/easybank-landing-page-grid-css-animations-js-scss-PC1gxE5Df)
- Live Site URL: [https://fm-easybank-landing.vercel.app/](https://fm-easybank-landing.vercel.app/)

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Animations
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When I uploaded my solution to Vercel, I noticed the hero background image was loading slower and showing up halfway through the animation. I used [this handy solution from CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/making-animations-wait/), which utilizes the `animation-play-state` property in order to pause the animations until images are loaded.

### Extras

Additions that go beyond the original challenge and design:

- The mobile menu will close if clicking outside the menu or header (as well as by using the menu button, of course).
- Animated hero section, with slightly different versions for mobile and desktop layouts.
